 While the losses that their economists predicted have yet to materialize, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
 (JPM)
 and the 20 other firms that trade with the Federal Reserve
 began wagering
 on a Treasuries selloff last month for the first time since 2011. The strategy was upended as Fed Chair
 Janet Yellen
 signaled she wasn’t in a rush to lift interest rates
 , two weeks after suggesting the opposite
 at the bank’s March 19 meeting.
 The surprising resilience of Treasuries has investors re-calibrating forecasts for higher borrowing costs
 as lackluster job growth and emerging-market turmoil push yields toward 2014 lows. That’s also made
 the business of trading
 bonds, once more predictable for dealers when the Fed was buying trillions of
 dollars of debt to spur the economy, less profitable as new rules limit the risks they can take with their
 own money.
 “You have an uncertain Fed, an uncertain direction of the economy and you’ve got rates moving,”
 Mark MacQueen, a partner at Sage Advisory Services Ltd., which oversees $10 billion, said by
 telephone from Austin, Texas
 . In the past, “calling the direction of the market and what you should be
 doing in it was a lot easier than it is today, particularly for the dealers.”
 Treasuries (USGG10YR)
 have confounded economists who predicted 10-year yields would approach
 3.4 percent by year-end as a strengthening economy prompts the Fed to pare its unprecedented bond
 buying.
